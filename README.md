### Project Recursion

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice recursion by solving a few problems using recursion.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The first part of the project is to write a recursive method that returns the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence starts as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

2. **Merge Sort**: The second part of the project is to write a recursive method that implements the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves.
